                <h2>Bio</h2>
               
			   <p>In 2002 I recevied my Music Examinations Degreee in Piano, in the <a href="http://conservatoriovalladolid.centros.educa.jcyl.es/sitio/">Conservatory of Valladolid</a> (Spain). 
			   I started Telecommunications Engineering in Universidad de Valladolid, in 2009 I received my M.Sc. in Telecommunications Eng. (UEM, Madrid), and M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering in 2009 (Chalmers, Goteborg), respectively. In 2009 I spent six months as an intern in the Biomedical Signal Processing in Phillips, Aachen.</p>

			   <p>I started my first job in a multinational called Mach Connectivity (Now bought by Syniverse) as an implementation Engineer and Service Manager. I swichtched quickly to Biomedical again, and started a developer in eHealth, at the Zentrum für Telematik e.V. (Germany) for the design of a home dialysis infrastructure for Fresenious Medical Care. </p>

			   <p> I was shortly a fellow in University of Valladolid, in the Group of Biomedical Engineering, supervised by Roberto Hornero and Carlos Gomez in Magnetoencefalography EMG). I held a position as a researcher in the Personal Health Informatics group in <a href="http://www.tut.fi/">Tampere University of Technology </a>(Finland). During this time, I was a collaborator at PROTOMO (Start-up incubator in Tampere), shorty at WERK1 (Start-up incubator in Munich), and some additional collaborations.</p>

			   <p>Currently, I held a PhD. candidate position as a fellow in Tampere University of Technology, Finland.</p>

                <h2>Research</h2>
				The topic of my doctoral thesis was centred on sleep, unobtrusive sensors and <mark>mattress sensors</mark> (such as Beddit, Emfit, Fitbit, Firstbeat, raw accelerometers, etc). The thesis proposes several state-of-the-art methods for detecting snoring, breathing efforts, breathing patterns, and breathing events algorithms.<br>

				I am also interested in high-performance programming.
				
				<p>The topic of my doctoral thesis was centred around <mark>nonlocal imaging</mark> methods for multidimensional data restoration. The thesis proposes several state-of-the-art restoration and enhancement algorithms leveraging novel multidimensional data models combined with nonlocal paradigms and sparsifying spectral techniques. These algorithms have found practical applications in medical, thermal, as well as consumer imaging.</p>
                <p>Currently, my research interests mainly focus on sampling theory applied to <mark>upsampling and super-resolution</mark> of images as well as videos, and thus complements my image processing background with elements of sparse sampling theory, transform-domain techniques, and computer vision methods.</p>
                <p>I am also interested in high-performance implementation of numerical and imaging algorithms on CPU.</p>
