		Some days ago, I read Derek was checking Now pages, so I had to update! Hi Derek! I might be too late though. 
		I read some of his posts, books sometimes, they are inspiring.
		The thing is that reading my previous now page and the new I am doing... is USEFUL.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Life and Purpose
	</h2>
	<ul>

		<li>I am making a list of movies, and series episodes, that have inspired me a lot. For those times where I need to find my north. 
			It is an ongoing process but I have a decent one.
		</li>
		<li>Watching old movies, like very old --around 1930s, 40s, 50s and so on, such as Rear Window, wow, Grace Kelly was amazing, 
			Her dresses even more so. James Stewards movies... classic actors. Writing a list as well. Why would anyone wastedtime watching not so good
			things when I can have a curated list of my interests? Anyhow, I find that the dialoges and stories of old movies fascinating.
		</li>
		<li><b>LESS IS MORE</b>, simplicity, hard lesson to learn, and I am cleaning up files, videos, and accepting that maybe now, 
			I do not need to meet so many people or friends all the time. It is hard to explain exactly what I mean by less is more in one line, but it has to do with our human limiations.
		</li>
		<li>I am reading about religion, philosophy, and phychology.I am in that stage in life.
			Researching the meaning of life, purpose, happiness. I am discovering nothing new, but neither did I when I learned to walk.
			I am trying to go throuh Man's Search for Meaning, far from over.
			Praying. I have now a strong faith. It was not like this before. 
			For me, now, faith is transparent, more than ever, hard to explain. John, Ch9, V25. (The Game, 1997, or the Bible, however you want to see it).
		</li>
		<li>I have been and still updating myself about latest health research. Made myself a plan that I am following. 
			Started doing Pilates, Yoga, and stretching. The latter ones were true discovery 
			that I was suggeted to do --no kidding-- over 1000 times. I finally listened. I should listen more often, 
			or at least try with intention. Now Yoda comes to the rescue.
		</li>
		<li>I am doing the masterplan, no matter what. I feel like Daniel-san when doing those exercises, 
			and the challenge motivates me a lot. Cooking with care, and I am doing it in the most "Japanese" ritual way as possible. 
			as I said, now I have even more faith.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Professional
	</h2>
	<ul> 
		<li>Looking for a challenge to solve in a motivated team, maybe even lead them? 
			Exploring entrepeneurship and exploring once again my curiosity.
		</li>
		<li>Researching wearables, sleep, snoring, and physiological signals. Deep Learning, 
			Machine Learning, statistical learning... you name it. I do like research and find out things.
		</li>
		<li>Researching a lot business models, digital models, and so on. I think this is superuseful.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		PhD Thesis
	</h2>
	<p>
		After some years of hard work, and I am almost ready with my PhD.
	</p>
	<h2>
		I am... 
	</h2>
	<p>
		Originally from Spain. Great place. We dwell a lot among ourselves though. It seems if nothing changes, 
		I might stay here for some more years. Moved here in 2012 and it seems to be the place to be at the moment. 
		My home. I have lived in the US, Germany, and Sweden.
	</p>
	<h2>
		SOFTWARE
	</h2>
	<p>
		Building apps, websites, scripts, AI systems, that I can show, or where I can start a business. I am in the process to host my own servers at home.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Reading
	</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>I wrote it above, dacapo, reading about religion, philosophy, psychology.
		</li>
		<li>I read a lot of scientific articles, and patents, what can I say, they are kind of fun. Also the best way to keep updated.
		</li>
		<li>Last year I was studying Spanish law for an exam. I discovered the amazing world of Law. 
			It is like reading a society manual instructions. Better than reading patents! It is a super-power.
		</li>
		<li>Reading about prebuilt homes, solar installations, electric bikes, electric scooters, cars. I now think of a car like a dangerous Mecano.
			I want to make a mini-solar installations. However, I would like to crack the numbers, in money, efficiency, differences,  improvements, etc.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>
		Looking for Love!
	</h2>
	<p>
		I was looking for love. Now, I am focusing on my inner me, open to new relationships and friendships though. Perhaps, here, I cannot find the droids I was looking for.
