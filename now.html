		Some days ago, I read Derek was checking Now pages, so I had to update! Hi Derek! I might be too late though. 
		I read some of his posts, books sometimes, they are inspiring. 
		The thing is that reading my previous page and the new I am doing... it is USEFUL.

	<h2>
		Life and Purpose
	</h2>
	<ul>
		<br>
		I enjoyed singing in Teekarikuoro, I did not come back. Unfortunately. 
		I was in Toastmasters, where I exercised speech and leadership skills, 
		I had the priviledge to be President, and VP-Membership. I am not active anymore, 
		I played basketball on Weekends, but not as often due to a knee injury. Since early 2023, 
		I cannot run, and have trouble walking sometimes. Working on it.<br>
		<br>
		<li>I am making a list of movies that have inspired me a lot. For those times where I need to find my north. 
			It is an ongoing process but I have a decent one.
		</li>
		<li>Watching old movies, like very old, such as Rear Window, wow, Grace Kelly was amazing, 
			and the dresses even more so. James Stewards movies... and so on. Making a list as well. 
			I find the dialoges and the stories fascinating.
		</li>
		<li>LESS IS MORE, hard lesson to learn, and I am cleaning up files, videos, and accepting that maybe now, 
			I do not need to meet so many people or friends.
		</li>
		<li>I am reading about religion, philosophy, and phychology. 
			The meaning of life, purpose happiness. 
			I am trying to go throuh Man's Search for Meaning. 
			Praying. I have a strong faith, more than ever. 
			For me, now, faith is transparent, although my current path, 
			is full of stones and my backpack very heavy, I am unloading and sharing.
		</li>
		<li>I have been and still updating myself about latest health research. Made myself a plan that I am following. 
			Started doing Pilates, Yoga, and stretching. The latter ones were true discovery 
			that I was suggeted to do --no kidding-- over 1000 times. I finally listened. I should listen more often, 
			or at least try with intention. Now Yoda comes to the rescue.
		</li>
		<li>I am doing the plan, no matter what. I feel like Daniel-san when doing those exercises, 
			and the challenge motivates me a lot. Cooking with care, and I am doing it in the most "Japanese" ritual way as possible. 
			as I said, now I have even more faith.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Professional
	</h2>
	<ul> 
		<li>Looking for a challenge to solve in a motivated team, maybe even lead them? 
			Exploring entrepeneurship and exploring once again my curiosity.
		</li>
		<li>Researching wearables, sleep, snoring, and physiological signals. Deep Learning, 
			Machine Learning, statistical learning... you name it. I do like research and find out things.
		</li>I do like machine audition and sounds though!
		<li>Researching a lot business models, digital models, and so on. I think this is superuseful
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		PhD Thesis
	</h2>
	<p>
		After some years of hard work, and I am almost ready with my PhD.
	</p>
	<h2>
		I AM LIVING PERMANENTLY IN FINLAND
	</h2>
	<p>
		Originally from Spain. Great place. We dwell a lot among ourselves though. It seems if nothing changes, 
		I might stay here for some more years. Moved here in 2012 and it seems to be the place to be at the moment. 
		My home. I have lived in the US, Germany, and Sweden.
	</p>
	<h2>
		SOFTWARE
	</h2>
	<p>
		Building apps, websites, scripts, AI systems, that I can show, or where I can start a business. I am in the process to host my own servers at home.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Reading
	</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>I said before, tell again, reading about religion, philosophy, psychology.
		</li>
		<li>I read a lot of scientific articles, and patents, what can I say, they are kind of fun.
		</li>
		<li>Last year I was studying Spanish law for an exam. I discovered the amazing world of Law. 
			It is like reading a society manual instructions. Better than reading patents!
		</li>
		<li>Reading about prebuilt homes, solar installations, electric bikes, electric scooters. \I want to make a mini-solar installations.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>
		Looking for Love!
	</h2>
	<p>
		I was looking for love. Now, I am focusing on myself, open to new relationships and friendships though.
