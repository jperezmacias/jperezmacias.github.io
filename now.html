		Some days ago, I read Derek was checking Now pages, so I had to update! Hi Derek! I might be too late though. 
		I read some of his posts, books sometimes, they are inspiring. Check him out <a href="https://www.sive.rs">sive.rs</a>.
		The thing is that reading my previous now page and the new I am doing... is USEFUL.
	</p>
	
	<h2>
		Software 
	</h2>
	<p>
		Building apps, scripts, AI systems, that I can show, or where I can start a business. I am in the process to host my own servers at home.
	</p>
	<p>
		I maintain some hobby websites. I swith to static 'compiled' websites.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Professional
	</h2>
	<ul> 
		<li>Building a portfolio of AI working models on servers.
		</li>
		<li>Looking for a challenge to solve in a motivated team. Exploring entrepeneurship and exploring once again my curiosity. I am building mini-products.
		</li>
		<li>Researching wearables, sleep, snoring, and physiological signals. Deep Learning, 
			Machine Learning, statistical learning... you name it. I do like research and find out things.
		</li>
		<li>Researching a lot business models, digital models, and start-ups. I am interested in building my own company.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>		I am... 
	</h2>
	<p>
		Originally from Spain. 
		I might stay here for some more years. Moved here in 2012 and it seems to be the place to be at the moment. 
		I have lived in the US, Germany, Finland, and Sweden.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Reading
	</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>I wrote it above, dacapo, reading about religion, philosophy, psychology.
		</li>
		<li>I read a lot of scientific articles, and patents, what can I say, they are kind of fun. Also the best way to keep updated.
		</li>
		<li>Last year I was studying Spanish law for an exam. I discovered the amazing world of Law. 
			It is like reading a society manual instructions. Better than reading patents! It is a super-power.
		</li>
		<li>Reading about prebuilt homes, solar installations, electric bikes, electric scooters, cars. I now think of a car like a dangerous Mecano.
			I want to make a mini-solar installations. However, I would like to crack the numbers, in money, efficiency, differences,  improvements, etc.
		</li>
	</ol>


	<h2>
		Life and Purpose
	</h2>
	<ul>
		As important as it is, sometimes I have not put enough attention into this.

		<li>I am making a list of movies, and series episodes that have inspired me, and keep inspiring me. For those times where I need to find my north. It is an ongoing process but I have a decent one.
		</li>
		<li>Watching old movies, like very old --around 1930s, 40s, 50s and so on, such as Rear Window, wow! Grace Kelly was amazing, 
			Her dresses are amazing. The conversations are even funny. James Stewards movies... classic actors. I am writing a list as well. Why would anyone waste time watching not so good movies when I can have a curated list of my interests? Anyhow, I find that the dialoges and stories of old movies fascinating.
		</li>
		<li><b>LESS IS MORE</b>, simplicity, hard lesson to learn, and I am cleaning up files, videos, and accepting that maybe now, that 
			I do not need to meet so many people or friends all the time. It is hard to explain exactly what I mean by less is more in one line, but it has to do with our human limiations.
		</li>
		<li>I am reading about religion, philosophy, and phychology. I am in that stage in life.
			Researching the meaning of life, purpose, and happiness. I am discovering nothing new, but neither did I when I learned to walk.
			I am trying to go through Man's Search for Meaning, far from over. Praying. I have now a strong faith. It was not like this before. 
			For me, now, faith is transparent, more than ever, hard to explain. John, Ch9, V25. However, I still think it is not important to answer some questions, but the path. It is USEFUL. It is just one of the many manuals for happiness.
		</li>
		<li>I have been and still updating myself about latest health research. Made myself a plan that I am following. 
			Started doing Pilates, Yoga, and stretching. The latter ones were true discovery 
			that I was suggeted to do --no kidding-- over 1000 times. I finally listened. I should listen more often, 
			or at least try with intention. Now Yoda comes to the rescue.
		</li>
		<li>I am doing the masterplan, no matter what. I stole the word from Elon. I liked his last Masterplan. I feel like Daniel-san when doing those Pilates/Yoga exercises, and the challenge motivates me a lot. Cooking with care, and I am doing it in the most "Japanese" ritual way as possible.
		</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>
		Looking for Love!
	</h2>
	<p>
		I was looking for love. Now, I am focusing on my inner me, open to new relationships and friendships though. Perhaps, here, I cannot find the droids I was looking for.
