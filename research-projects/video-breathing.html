    <h2>Overview</h2>
    Exploring novel approaches to assess breathing patterns by integrating video-based analysis with other sensor signals.
    <h2>Background</h2>
    Traditional respiratory monitoring often relies on sensors placed on the body. Video-based methods, combined with signal processing from various sources, can offer some advantages.
       <h2>Aim</h2>
       To develop techniques that use video streams and supplemental signals to accurately measure and evaluate breathing patterns without direct contact.
    <h2>Methods</h2>
    Employing computer vision algorithms, optical flow, and machine learning to extract respiratory information from video, while integrating data from other non-invasive sensors for improved reliability.
       <h2>Results</h2>
       
       Initial tests indicate that combining video analysis with additional signals can enhance breathing pattern detection, providing a contactless alternative for respiratory monitoring
