                (This is <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">a now page</a>, and if you have your own site, <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">you should make one</a>, too.)

            <p>I enjoy singing in Teekarikuoro, although I am not participating much lately, mostly due to corona.
            I also joined Toastmasters, where I exercise speech and leadership skills.
            I play basketball on Weekends, but not as often due to a knee injury.

            <br /> Looking for a challenge to solve in a motivated team, maybe even lead them?
            Researching wearables, sleep, snoring, and physiological signals.
            Deep Learning, Machine Learning, statistical learning... you name it. I do like research and find out things.
            I do like machine audition and sounds though!

            <h2>PhD Thesis</h2>
            <p>
                After some years of hard work, and I am almost ready with my PhD.

            </p>

            <h2>I AM "ALMOST" LIVING PERMANENTLY IN FINLAND</h2>
            <p>
                Originally from Spain. Great place.
                It seems if nothing changes, I might stay here for some more years.
                Moved here in 2012 and it seems to be the place to be at the moment. My home.
                I have lived in the US, Germany, and Sweden. Pretty interesting places too.

            </p>

            <h2>SOFTWARE</h2>
            <p>
                Doing some super-small projects. My head is full with other things.
            </p>

            <h2>Reading</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>I don’t read much more than some books, mostly historical, or life-related.
                    I am lately interested in history, and life stories.</li>
                <li>I read a lot of scientific articles, and general science in general.
                    It is a hobby that I like to exercise.
                </li>
                <li>I started to post my book notes. I find it an interesting exercise.
                Hopefully soon, I will post them here.</li>

            </ol>


            <h2>Looking for Love!</h2>
            <p>
                finally! a lot of love in my live already, but ... sharing is living. 
            </p>
